# Codebase Architecture Analyst

This skill performs comprehensive, deep analysis of codebases with file-level understanding, interactive dependency querying, and human-readable architectural insights. It scans every source file, understands their purpose through documentation and code analysis, maps detailed dependencies, and enables interactive exploration of the codebase structure.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when users ask to:
- "Reverse engineer this project"
- "Generate architecture from code"
- "Explain this project"  
- "Analyze codebase architecture"
- "Document this system's architecture"
- "What files depend on [filename]?"
- "Show me the dependency graph for [component]"
- "Explain the security architecture"
- "Give me a human-readable overview of [aspect]"
- "Run a security analysis on this codebase"
- "Find security vulnerabilities in this code"
- "Perform a security audit"
- "Scan for vulnerabilities"
- "Check for OWASP issues"
- "Find secrets or credentials in the code"
- "Analyze the attack surface"
- "Generate a security report"

## Deep Analysis Capabilities

### File-Level Understanding
- **Documentation Extraction**: Reads docstrings, comments, and README files in each source file
- **Code Purpose Analysis**: Analyzes code structure when documentation is missing
- **Function/Class Mapping**: Catalogs all exported functions, classes, and their purposes
- **File Responsibility**: Determines each file's role and responsibility in the system

### Interactive Dependency Analysis
- **Bi-directional Dependencies**: "What depends on this file?" and "What does this file depend on?"
- **Function-level Dependencies**: Granular mapping of function and class usage
- **Dependency Querying**: Answer specific questions about relationships
- **Impact Analysis**: "If I change this file, what else is affected?"

### Human-Readable Insights
- **Security Overview**: Plain English explanation of security patterns and concerns
- **Architecture Summary**: Clear description of system organization and design
- **Component Relationships**: How different parts of the system work together
- **Technology Decisions**: Why certain technologies and patterns were chosen

## Enhanced Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Deep Source File Analysis
1. **Scan all source files** using `search_subagent` to discover every code file
2. **Analyze each file individually** using `scripts/analyze_source_files.py`:
   - Extract documentation, docstrings, and comments
   - Analyze code structure and purpose when docs are missing
   - Catalog functions, classes, exports, and interfaces
   - Determine file responsibility and role
3. **Create file inventory** with detailed descriptions for every source file
4. **Map technology stack** from actual code analysis

### Phase 2: Deep Dependency & Relationship Mapping  
1. **Extract granular dependencies** using `scripts/deep_dependency_analyzer.py`:
   - File-to-file dependencies (imports, requires, includes)
   - Function-to-function usage patterns
   - Class inheritance and composition relationships
   - API and interface dependencies
2. **Build bi-directional dependency graph** with queryable structure
3. **Create impact analysis mappings** ("what affects what")
4. **Generate dependency query database** for interactive exploration

### Phase 3: Human-Readable Analysis & Documentation
1. **Generate human-readable overviews** using analysis data:
   - **Security Overview**: Plain English security analysis
   - **Architecture Summary**: Clear system organization explanation  
   - **Component Guide**: How different parts work together
2. **Create interactive dependency explorer** for answering questions
3. **Generate comprehensive documentation** with file-level insights
4. **Produce visual diagrams** showing detailed relationships

## Analysis Approach by Codebase Type

### Web Applications
- Identify frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular)
- Map component hierarchy and state management
- Analyze routing and page structure
- Document API integration patterns

### Backend APIs
- Map endpoint structure and routing
- Identify middleware and authentication
- Analyze database integration patterns
- Document service layer architecture

### Microservices
- Map service boundaries and communication
- Analyze inter-service dependencies
- Document deployment and orchestration
- Identify shared infrastructure patterns

### Monolithic Applications
- Map layer separation (presentation, business, data)
- Analyze module organization
- Document internal APIs and interfaces
- Identify refactoring opportunities

## Interactive Dependency Querying

### Query Types Supported
- **"What files depend on [filename]?"** - Find all files that import/use this file
- **"What does [filename] depend on?"** - Show all dependencies of this file
- **"Show me the dependency tree for [component]"** - Hierarchical view of dependencies
- **"If I change [filename], what else is affected?"** - Impact analysis
- **"What functions from [filename] are used by [other-file]?"** - Function-level usage
- **"Show me all circular dependencies"** - Detect dependency cycles
- **"What are the entry points to the system?"** - Find main/root files

### Query Execution Process
1. **Parse user question** to identify query type and target files/components
2. **Search dependency database** built during analysis phase
3. **Generate relevant subgraph** showing requested relationships
4. **Provide human-readable explanation** of findings
5. **Suggest follow-up questions** for deeper exploration

## Human-Readable Analysis Outputs

### Security Analysis Overview
**Example Output**: "This system implements authentication through JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies. The main security concerns are in the user input validation (3 files lack proper sanitization) and the API endpoints don't have rate limiting. The password handling uses bcrypt which is good, but some environment variables containing secrets are logged in development mode."

### Architecture Analysis Overview  
**Example Output**: "This is a layered web application with React frontend, Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL database. The frontend components are well-organized by feature, the backend follows REST API patterns with middleware for auth and logging, and database access uses an ORM with proper migrations. The main architectural strength is clear separation of concerns, but the frontend state management could benefit from a more structured approach."

### Component Relationship Guide
**Example Output**: "The UserService component is central to the system - it's used by 8 other components for authentication, profile management, and user data. If you're modifying user-related functionality, you'll likely need to touch UserService, UserController (handles HTTP requests), UserModel (database schema), and AuthMiddleware (validates permissions)."

## Security Vulnerability Testing Framework

This section defines how to perform a comprehensive security analysis beyond the high-level security overview. When a user requests a security audit or the analysis warrants deep security examination, execute this framework in addition to (or instead of) the standard architecture analysis.

---

### Security Test Categories

Organize the security analysis around these categories. For each, document: findings, severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low / Info), file locations, and remediation advice.

#### Category 1 — OWASP Top 10 (2021)

| ID | Vulnerability | What to Check in Code |
|---|---|---|
| A01 | Broken Access Control | Authorization checks on every route/function; privilege escalation paths; IDOR patterns; directory traversal |
| A02 | Cryptographic Failures | Weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1, DES, RC4); plaintext secrets; unencrypted data at rest/transit; improper key management; missing TLS enforcement |
| A03 | Injection | SQL/NoSQL/LDAP/XPath injection; OS command injection; template injection; eval/exec with user input; subprocess with shell=True |
| A04 | Insecure Design | Missing threat model controls; insecure defaults; lack of rate limiting; business logic flaws; trust boundary violations |
| A05 | Security Misconfiguration | Debug mode in production; default credentials; unnecessary features enabled; verbose error messages exposing internals; permissive CORS |
| A06 | Vulnerable Components | Outdated dependencies with known CVEs; unmaintained packages; transitive dependency risks |
| A07 | Auth & Identity Failures | Weak password policies; missing MFA; insecure session tokens; credential exposure in logs/errors; brute-force vulnerability |
| A08 | Data Integrity Failures | Unsafe deserialization (pickle, yaml.load, marshal); unsigned data; auto-update without integrity checks |
| A09 | Logging & Monitoring Failures | Secrets in log output; insufficient audit logging; log injection; PII in logs |
| A10 | SSRF | User-controlled URLs fetched server-side; insufficient URL validation; internal network reachability |

#### Category 2 — Language-Specific Vulnerability Patterns

**Python:**
- `eval()`, `exec()`, `compile()` with unsanitized input
- `pickle.loads()`, `marshal.loads()`, `yaml.load()` (unsafe), `shelve` with untrusted data
- `subprocess.run(shell=True, ...)` or `os.system()` with user-controlled input
- `open()` with user-controlled file paths (path traversal)
- `__import__()` or `importlib.import_module()` with user-controlled module names
- Regex denial-of-service (ReDoS) via catastrophic backtracking
- `tempfile.mktemp()` (non-atomic) vs `tempfile.mkstemp()` (safe)
- Hardcoded credentials or secrets in source files
- `assert` statements used for security checks (stripped in optimized mode)
- Integer overflow in cryptographic operations
- Timing attacks in credential comparison (use `hmac.compare_digest`)
- Mutable default arguments leaking state between calls

**JavaScript / TypeScript:**
- `eval()`, `Function()`, `setTimeout(string)` with user input
- Prototype pollution via `Object.assign`, `_.merge`, or similar
- `innerHTML`, `document.write()`, `outerHTML` with untrusted data (XSS)
- `child_process.exec()` with user-controlled strings
- `require()` with user-controlled module paths
- Missing `httpOnly` / `secure` / `SameSite` cookie flags
- JWT without algorithm enforcement (`alg: none` attack)
- Path traversal via `path.join()` with user input
- ReDoS in regex patterns

**Go:**
- `os/exec.Command` with unsanitized arguments
- `fmt.Sprintf` format string injection in non-string contexts
- Integer overflow / underflow in crypto operations
- `ioutil.ReadFile` / `os.Open` with user-controlled paths
- Missing TLS certificate verification (`InsecureSkipVerify: true`)
- Goroutine leaks leading to resource exhaustion

**Java:**
- SQL injection via string concatenation in JDBC
- Deserialization via `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` with untrusted data
- XML External Entity (XXE) in XML parsers without `FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING`
- `Runtime.exec()` / `ProcessBuilder` with user input
- JNDI lookup injection (Log4Shell pattern)
- Unsafe reflection via `Class.forName()` with user input

#### Category 3 — Secrets & Credential Exposure

Search for:
- Hardcoded API keys, tokens, and passwords in source files
- Credentials committed to version control (including git history)
- Secrets in configuration files not excluded from VCS
- Environment variable names suggesting secrets logged at startup
- Base64-encoded strings that decode to credentials
- Private keys (PEM/DER) in repository
- Database connection strings with embedded passwords
- `.env` files committed to source control

Patterns to scan for (regex):
```
(password|passwd|pwd|secret|api_key|apikey|access_token|auth_token|private_key|client_secret)\s*[=:]\s*['"][^'"]{8,}['"]
(AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16})                          # AWS Access Key ID
(sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{32,})                        # OpenAI API key
(ghp_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36})                        # GitHub Personal Access Token
(eyJ[A-Za-z0-9-_=]+\.[A-Za-z0-9-_=]+\.?)    # JWT tokens
-----BEGIN (RSA |EC |DSA |OPENSSH )?PRIVATE KEY-----
```

#### Category 4 — Dependency Vulnerabilities

- Match all declared dependencies against public CVE databases (NVD, OSV, GitHub Advisory)
- Check for dependencies with no recent activity (abandoned packages)
- Check for typosquatting risk in dependency names
- Identify dependencies with known supply chain incidents
- Check lock files are present and committed (prevents dependency confusion attacks)
- Verify integrity hashes in lock files are not manually modified

#### Category 5 — Cryptographic Implementation

- Hash functions used: prohibit MD5 and SHA1 for security purposes (allow for checksums)
- Symmetric encryption: prohibit ECB mode; require authenticated encryption (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Asymmetric encryption: require key sizes ≥2048 bits for RSA, ≥256 bits for EC
- Random number generation: prohibit `random` module for security; require `secrets` or `os.urandom`
- Password hashing: require bcrypt, argon2, or scrypt; prohibit MD5/SHA for passwords
- TLS: require TLS 1.2+; prohibit SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1
- Key derivation: require PBKDF2, bcrypt, or argon2; prohibit simple hashing
- Certificate validation: must not skip cert verification
- Nonce/IV reuse: check for reused initialization vectors

#### Category 6 — Input Validation & Sanitization

- All external inputs validated before use (CLI args, env vars, files, network responses)
- File paths sanitized for traversal sequences (`../`, `..\\`, URL-encoded variants)
- Integer inputs checked for overflow/underflow before arithmetic
- String lengths validated before processing
- Structured data (JSON, XML, YAML) parsed with size/depth limits
- Regular expressions audited for catastrophic backtracking (ReDoS)
- Filenames sanitized before use in filesystem operations
- URLs validated for scheme and host before fetch

#### Category 7 — Error Handling & Information Disclosure

- Stack traces not exposed in user-facing output
- Internal paths not revealed in error messages
- Database errors not propagated to API responses
- Version numbers and framework info not leaked in headers/responses
- Sensitive field values not included in exception messages
- Logging of request/response bodies excludes sensitive fields

#### Category 8 — Race Conditions & Concurrency

- TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use): check-then-act on filesystem resources
- File creation in shared temp directories without exclusive access
- Non-atomic operations on shared resources without locking
- Signal handler safety (async-signal-safe functions only)
- Concurrent map/dict access without synchronization (in goroutines, threads)

---

### Automated Tool Scanning Approach

#### Language Detection

Before selecting tools, identify the language(s) in the codebase by checking:
- File extensions (`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.go`, `.java`, `.kt`, `.cs`, `.rb`, `.php`, `.rs`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.swift`)
- Build/manifest files: `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `*.csproj`, `Gemfile`, `composer.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`
- Configuration files: `Dockerfile`, `*.tf`, `*.yaml`/`*.yml` (K8s/Ansible), `*.bicep`

A project may have multiple languages (e.g., Python backend + TypeScript frontend + Terraform IaC). Run tools for **all** detected languages.

#### Tool Selection by Language

For each detected language, run the tools listed below and save output to `security/tool-scan-results/{tool-name}/`.

#### Tool Availability and Fallback Strategy

When executing the security analysis, follow this decision tree for each tool:

1. **Check if the tool is available**: run `which {tool}` or `{tool} --version`
2. **If available**: execute it immediately with JSON output
3. **If not available — try Docker**: check if Docker is running (`docker info`). If yes, use the container variant:
   - `semgrep`: `docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/src" semgrep/semgrep semgrep --config=p/python --json /src`
   - `sonarqube`: `docker run -d -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:latest` then `sonar-scanner`
   - `trivy`: `docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/src" aquasec/trivy fs --format json /src`
   - `checkov`: `docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/src" bridgecrew/checkov -d /src --output json`
4. **If Docker is also unavailable — provide manual instructions**: document in `security/tool-scan-results/{tool-name}/SKIPPED.md` the exact command to run, what it checks, and why it was skipped. Include install instructions.
5. **Never fail silently**: always record which tools ran, which were skipped, and why, in `security/detailed-security-analysis.md` under "Scope & Methodology".

#### Tool Execution Workflow

1. **Detect all languages and IaC types** from file extensions and manifest files
2. **Select applicable tools** from the per-language tables above, plus always run the Universal tools
3. **Check tool availability** for each; apply the fallback strategy above
4. **Execute in this order**: secrets scanners first → dependency scanners → SAST tools → universal tools
5. **Save all raw output** to `security/tool-scan-results/{tool-name}/`
6. **Interpret each tool's output** using the Tool Output Interpretation Guide below
7. **Normalize findings** into the unified `vulnerability-report.json` schema
8. **De-duplicate** findings reported by multiple tools for the same issue (keep highest-confidence source)
9. **Assign final severity** using CVSS 3.1 base score where available, else use tool-assigned severity
10. **Proceed to AI-assisted manual review** to discover issues tools missed

#### Tool Output Interpretation Guide

After running each tool, interpret its output before incorporating findings. Each tool has different severity scales, false-positive rates, and coverage areas:

**`bandit` (Python)**
- Severity levels: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW (map to finding severity directly)
- Confidence levels: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW — **only promote LOW confidence findings if corroborated by code review**
- Common false positives: B101 (assert in tests — suppress in test files), B105/B106/B107 (hardcoded passwords in test fixtures), B311 (random for non-security use)
- High-signal test IDs to prioritize: B602 (subprocess shell=True), B301/B302 (pickle), B506 (unsafe YAML), B105 (hardcoded passwords outside tests), B608 (SQL injection)
- Interpretation: read `issue_text` and `test_id` fields; cross-reference `filename` and `line_number` with actual code to confirm exploitability

**`semgrep`**
- Severity from `extra.severity`: ERROR (critical/high), WARNING (medium), INFO (low)
- Check `extra.metadata.confidence` — LOW confidence rules generate many false positives
- Rules from `p/secrets` pack: treat any match as High until manually verified to be a real secret vs. example/test value
- Check `extra.metadata.cwe` and `extra.metadata.owasp` fields to classify the finding
- Interpretation: read `extra.message` for plain English explanation; `path` and `start.line` for location; `extra.fix` for suggested remediation if present

**`pip-audit` / `safety` / `npm audit` / `cargo audit` / `bundle-audit` / `govulncheck` / `grype`** (dependency scanners)
- These report **known CVEs against pinned versions** — all findings are true positives by definition
- Assess severity from the CVSS score in the CVE record, not the tool's own severity label
- Check if the vulnerable code path is actually reachable in the project (a CVE in a transitive dep that isn't called is still a finding but lower priority)
- For each CVE: note fixed version, check if upgrading would break compatibility, and record in `dependency-audit.md`
- `govulncheck` specifically reports only **reachable** vulnerable functions — treat its findings as higher priority than generic dependency scanners

**`detect-secrets` / `truffleHog3` / `gitleaks`** (secrets scanners)
- Every finding must be **manually verified** as a real secret vs. a test value, placeholder, or example string
- Follow up: check git history to see if a real secret was ever committed (`git log -S "found-value"`)
- Classify as: Real Secret (Critical), Historical Exposure (High, if in git history but removed), False Positive (suppress with explanation)
- For real secrets: immediately flag as Critical; remediation requires rotating the credential, not just removing the code

**`gosec` (Go)**
- Severity: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW; Confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- Same confidence guidance as bandit — deprioritize LOW confidence unless code review confirms
- High-signal rule IDs: G101 (hardcoded credentials), G304 (file path from variable), G204 (subprocess with variable), G401-G403 (weak crypto), G501-G502 (weak hash)

**`brakeman` (Ruby/Rails)**
- Confidence levels: High / Medium / Weak — **Weak findings require manual verification before reporting**
- All High confidence findings are generally true positives
- Warning types to prioritize: `SQL`, `Command Injection`, `Remote Code Execution`, `Mass Assignment`, `Deserialize`

**`SpotBugs` + `find-sec-bugs` (Java)**
- Bug categories to prioritize: `INJECTION` (SQL, LDAP, XPath), `CRYPTO` (weak algorithms), `DESERIALIZATION`, `PATH_TRAVERSAL`
- Confidence (priority) levels 1-3: 1 = high confidence, 3 = low
- Cross-reference with source to confirm the data flow

**`psalm` (PHP taint analysis)**
- Taint errors are generally true positives — follow the taint source/sink chain in the output
- Taint sources: `TaintedInput`, `TaintedHtml`, `TaintedSql` — trace to the affected sink

**`cppcheck` / `flawfinder` (C/C++)**
- `flawfinder` risk levels 0-5: prioritize 4 and 5 (buffer overflows, format strings, race conditions)
- `cppcheck` severity: error > warning > style — focus on `error` and security-tagged warnings
- C/C++ findings almost always require code review to confirm exploitability given pointer complexity

**`checkov` / `trivy` / `tfsec` / `kics` (IaC)**
- Map checkov check IDs to CIS benchmarks or cloud provider security baselines
- `FAILED` checks are definite misconfigurations; assess true risk based on exposure (internet-facing vs. internal)
- trivy `CRITICAL`/`HIGH` misconfig findings should always be reported; `LOW` can be informational

**`CodeQL`**
- Results are high-confidence semantic findings — treat all results as true positives until code review disproves
- Alert rules map to CWEs; use the `@kind path-problem` alerts which show the full data-flow path
- Path-problem alerts (showing source → sink) are the most actionable — include the full path in findings

**General Interpretation Principles**
- **Corroboration**: a finding reported by two independent tools at the same location is almost certainly a true positive
- **Context is everything**: a `subprocess(shell=True)` is critical if the argument is user-controlled, informational if it's a hardcoded string
- **Severity adjustment**: downgrade tool-assigned severity if the finding is in test code, unreachable code, or behind strong input validation; upgrade if the attack surface is internet-facing
- **False positive documentation**: if a finding is suppressed as a false positive, document *why* in `vulnerability-report.json` under `suppressed_findings`

### AI-Assisted Security Discovery Methodology

Automated tools catch known patterns, but the AI agent can discover issues that require contextual reasoning. Apply these techniques systematically:

#### Technique 1 — Manual Taint Analysis

Trace user-controlled data from sources to sinks without relying on tool detection:

1. **Identify all input sources** in the codebase:
   - CLI arguments (`sys.argv`, `argparse`, `click` options)
   - Environment variables (`os.environ`)
   - File reads (contents of files specified by the user)
   - Network responses (data returned from external services)
   - Database query results
   - Deserialized data (JSON, YAML, pickle)

2. **Identify all dangerous sinks**:
   - OS command execution (`subprocess`, `os.system`, `eval`)
   - File system writes (with user-controlled paths)
   - SQL query construction
   - HTML rendering
   - Deserialization calls
   - Cryptographic operations

3. **Trace data flow** from each source to each sink:
   - Does user-controlled data reach the sink unmodified?
   - Are there validation/sanitization steps between source and sink?
   - Can the validation be bypassed?
   - Are there indirect paths through intermediate variables or function calls?

4. **Document each taint path** found, even if sanitized, noting the sanitization quality.

#### Technique 2 — Authentication & Authorization Logic Review

Manually review auth logic for flaws that tools miss:

1. **Authentication bypass conditions**: Are there code paths that skip authentication (early returns, exception handlers, feature flags)?
2. **Token validation completeness**: Are all required claims validated (expiry, issuer, audience, algorithm)?
3. **Session fixation**: Is the session token regenerated after privilege elevation?
4. **Credential comparison**: Are credentials compared in constant time to prevent timing attacks?
5. **Multi-step auth flow**: Can any step be skipped by crafting requests out of order?
6. **Password reset flows**: Is the reset token sufficiently random and short-lived?
7. **Auth state in shared memory**: Can auth state leak between requests in a concurrent environment?

#### Technique 3 — Business Logic Vulnerability Analysis

These are high-value findings that automated tools cannot detect:

1. **Order of operations flaws**: Can operations be performed in a sequence not intended by the designer?
2. **Numeric logic errors**: Integer overflow, float precision issues, off-by-one errors in security-relevant calculations
3. **State machine violations**: Can the system reach an invalid state through a sequence of valid operations?
4. **Negative value handling**: What happens if a quantity or count is negative?
5. **Boundary condition behavior**: What happens at exactly 0, MAX_INT, empty string, null/None?
6. **Trust boundaries**: Does the code correctly distinguish between trusted internal calls and untrusted external calls?

#### Technique 4 — Cryptographic Implementation Review

Review cryptographic code for implementation flaws:

1. Read every file that imports cryptographic libraries
2. Verify: correct algorithm, correct mode, correct key size
3. Check for: nonce/IV reuse, key derivation correctness, padding oracle susceptibility
4. Verify random number generation uses cryptographically secure sources
5. Check for custom cryptographic implementations (a red flag)
6. Verify certificate pinning or validation is not bypassed

#### Technique 5 — Dependency & Supply Chain Analysis

Beyond CVE lookups, reason about supply chain risk:

1. **Identify all direct dependencies** and their publishers
2. **Flag single-maintainer packages** with no governance structure
3. **Check for typosquatting risk**: are packages named suspiciously close to popular packages?
4. **Review postinstall scripts** in package.json or setup.py hooks that run on install
5. **Check for pinned vs. floating versions**: unpinned dependencies are a supply chain risk
6. **Review `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` for install-time code execution**

#### Technique 7 — Attack Surface Enumeration

Systematically catalog every point where the system accepts untrusted input:

1. List all CLI entry points and their accepted inputs
2. List all network-facing endpoints (if applicable)
3. List all files read from disk that contain external data
4. List all environment variables that affect security behavior
5. List all external processes invoked
6. For each surface: what is the trust level of the input? What is the blast radius if exploited?

#### AI Security Review Checklist (run through each source file)

For every file in the codebase, answer:
- [ ] Does this file accept external input? If so, is it validated?
- [ ] Does this file perform OS command execution? Is the command data tainted?
- [ ] Does this file deserialize external data? Is the deserializer safe?
- [ ] Does this file perform cryptographic operations? Are the algorithms correct?
- [ ] Does this file handle credentials or secrets? Are they handled safely?
- [ ] Does this file write to the filesystem? Are paths sanitized?
- [ ] Does this file make network requests? Does it validate the response?
- [ ] Does this file log data? Could sensitive data appear in logs?
- [ ] Does this file share state across requests/calls? Could it leak between callers?
- [ ] Does this file use third-party libraries in a way consistent with their secure usage docs?

### 7. Security Vulnerability Analysis

This phase produces the `security/` output directory with the detailed security report. Run after Phase 3 (dependency mapping) so the dependency data is available for supply chain analysis.

**Step 7a — Detect Language(s) and Select Tools**
- Identify primary language(s) from file extensions and build configuration
- Select applicable tools from the "Automated Tool Scanning Approach" section above
- Note any tools unavailable in the current environment with manual run instructions

**Step 7b — Execute Automated Scanners**
- Run each selected tool using the per-language tables in the Automated Tool Scanning Approach section
- Apply the Tool Availability and Fallback Strategy (check installed → try Docker → document skip)
- Save raw JSON output to `security/tool-scan-results/{tool-name}/`
- For each completed scan, apply the Tool Output Interpretation Guide to filter false positives before promoting findings

**Step 7c — AI-Assisted Manual Review**
For each security test category:
1. Perform taint analysis (Technique 1): trace all input sources to dangerous sinks
2. Review auth/authorization logic (Technique 2) for bypass conditions
3. Audit cryptographic implementations (Technique 4) file by file
4. Run the AI Security Review Checklist on every source file that handles external data
5. Enumerate and document the complete attack surface (Technique 7)

**Step 7d — Normalize and De-duplicate Findings**
- Combine tool findings and AI-identified findings into `vulnerability-report.json`
